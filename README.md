# Random-Password-Generator

## What is this app?
### This app is a random password generator. It generates a random password per user request.

## What motivated me to create it?
### I was motivated by the complexity of this project and the challenges that I have faced. It was extremely rewarding once I achieved the final result.

## Who can use this?
### This can be used by anyone who want to develop their knowledge in JavaScript. It is a bit chanllenging, but it is also extremely fun to create.

## Can this be used in real-world cases?
### As for now this is just at a testing stage and it is not recommended to be used for real-world cases, unles it is implemented together with a complete website.

## Help with the app:
### For this app I have received help from my tutor from line 143 until line 169; also from line 91 until line 101 I was advised to set out my variables out of the functions.
### The rest of the code is a combination of reasearch on the internet, asking for suggestions on different coding platforms and also a lot of tesing on my own until I reached the final result.
